This is the directory where all the pretrained weights for models and word embeddings are stored.

#### Setting pretrained weights for LSTM models
1. Download the pretrained weights in [link](http://minjechoi.com/data/www20/LSTM.zip).

2. Unzip the file to find 10 directories, each containing both the pretrained weights (best-weights.pth) and score on the test set (scores.txt) for each dimension.

3. Create
